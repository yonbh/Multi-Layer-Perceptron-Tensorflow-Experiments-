# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-Tensorflow-Experiments-
To explore the effects of manipulating values such as those of weights and biases to affect performance.

The purpose would be to help a beginner to look at a basic python tensorflow implementation of a feed forward neural network and manipulate layers to observe effects.



## Requirements:
 - TensorFlow
 - Matplotlib
 - Numpy
